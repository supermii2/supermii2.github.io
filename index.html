    <h1>Welcome to Alvis' landing page!</h1>
    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>Hi! I'm a Bachelor of Computer Science currently studying as an undergraduate in the National University of Singapore!
      In my free time, I enjoy solving crossword puzzles and going down random Wikipedia rabbit holes. 
      Here are some things you might know me from!</p>

    <h3>Super Smash Bros.</h3>
    <p>I used to compete in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate and Super Smash Bros. for Wii U under the tag <a href="https://www.ssbwiki.com/Smasher:PsineWave">PsineWave</a>.
      Though I have since retired from the competition to focus on under pursuits, I still maintain an active presence as a 
      tournament co-ordinator and organiser, working with *SCAPE with the SmashG team for the past two years.
      If you're interested in competing in in-person events, join <a href="https://discord.com/invite/qm3gYdx">our Discord server</a> for updates!
    </p>

    <h3>Pokemon Showdown</h3>
    <p>I'm an active writer for the <a href="https://play.pokemonshowdown.com/scavengers">scavengers room</a> for Pokemon Showdown, writing puzzles and trivia questions for the room.
    </p>

    
    <h2>Projects</h2>
